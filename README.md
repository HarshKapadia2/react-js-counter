## Functional Requirements

-   The counter can be initialized with a certain value. If no value is present at initialization then the counter will start at 1.
-   The counter can be initialized with a max value. If no max value is present, then assume that the max value will be 1000. If a max value is present then the counter can be incremented to only that max value.
-   The user can also type a value into the counter.

## Tech Stack

-   CSS (vanilla)
